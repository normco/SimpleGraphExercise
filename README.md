Simple Graph Implementation finding the shortest path from source node to destination node

It is using JDK8 syntax

Requirements:
- create Edges and Vertices
- Manipulate (Add/Remove Edges and Vertices)
- Query Edges for Vertex, determine Connectivity
- Allow Edges to have direction
- Allow edges to have labels
- Allow edges to have weights
- Allow the graph to be stored on disk or transmitted across a network
- Allow the graph to be manipulated and queried safely from multiple threads
- Find the shortest path between 2 vertices
